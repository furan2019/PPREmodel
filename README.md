# PPREmodel
This project is a complementary script to "Modeling the effects of phenotypic plasticity on hybrid performance in maize" published in Plant Communications. 
Many readers were interested in the heatmaps associated with this article. Therefore, we have uploaded this part of the script to github, and welcome your reference and citation. 
If you have other questions about the script, please feel free to communicate with me. 
Also, if you need further analysis of the script, you are welcome to actively contact us for cooperation.
